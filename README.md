ðŸ‘‹ Hey! If you are here it means you would like to learn how to build a component from scratch. You are at the right place!\
\
First of all, why should you? Over time successful products naturally evolve. New features are added, until things get complicated and creating a proper design system becomes indispensable. Starting from scratch can be intimidating but in this repository you will be able to find ready-to-use code to make it easy.\
\
We also recorded a webinar. Federica Vacca, Belkaâ€™s front-end engineer, will show you step-by step how to do it. ðŸ‘‰ Here you can watch it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fBjtWsEx6w&t=357s

### Project set up
Clone it, run `yarn` and then `yarn storybook` to view the components.
